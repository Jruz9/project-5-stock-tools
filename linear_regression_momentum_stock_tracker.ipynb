    "- In this project we are using linear regression to help detect mommentum in stocks and possbile things you can use to help someone in their endevor in the stock market. (optional)\n",
    "- The project uses data from alpaca and uses this article as a basis and is going to be more than what the author purpose dureing extraction of this data.\n",
    "- we may use google trends information and reddit growth to help give more confidence in our inference and how we can use it to detect alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "- we could include information from new(aka fud and options) to help but this will proably be just a optional if the above is completed.\n",

    "- Take a sector of stocks in a exchange like the nyse, dows, russell,etc. (use stock screeners to help decide dataset)\n",
    "- Use either the k clustering method and voalitiliy method for the analysis\n",
    "- Use g trend information to find possible information about trends in their sectors"
