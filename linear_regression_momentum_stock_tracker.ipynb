    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this project we will use k mean clustering to detect the voalatility of a sector of stocks.\n",
    "- In this project we are using linear regression to help detect mommentum in stocks and possbile things you can use to help someone in their endevor in the stock market. (optional)\n",
    "- The project uses data from alpaca and uses this article as a basis and is going to be more than what the author purpose dureing extraction of this data.\n",
    "- we may use google trends information and reddit growth to help give more confidence in our inference and how we can use it to detect alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "- we could include information from new(aka fud and options) to help but this will proably be just a optional if the above is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- this is just a set of tool to use to help with your analysis in the stock and cannot guarentee alpha.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Process:\n",
    "- Take a sector of stocks in a exchange like the nyse, dows, russell,etc. (use stock screeners to help decide dataset)\n",
    "- Prepare the linear regession on the stocks we picked with data\n",
    "- Look at what is looking good over a 6-18  month period.\n",
    "- \n",
    "- Use g trend information to find possible information about trends in their sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples:\n",
    "- Use abercrombie comming back from the dead. linear regession and google trends with 90's and leather pants\n",
    "- Use LAC information to tell the story of how lithium can be a play for the future vs tesla, lucid and rivian as comparision\n",
    "- Use a example from your analysis from the stock exhange you choose and use the method your thinking about\n",
    "\n",
    "## talking about it:\n",
    "- inform this method has not been proven and does not guarentee any money\n",
    "- does not take fundamentals or too many technicals in place.\n",
    "- market conditions can change and can affect investments regardless.\n",
    "- talk about the technicals (linear and google trends), connecting it with how the market is working and what could affect the trade and short term and long term\n",
    "- talk about google trends flaws with examples of chipotole and the lettuce problems or lulu lemon see through pants. (negative sediment) and lip balm (high chart but from only new york hmm?)\n",
